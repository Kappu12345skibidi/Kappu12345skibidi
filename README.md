That's awesome! Here’s a fun, concise bio you could use for personal or professional introductions:

---

I'm an infrastructural engineer with a passion for creative development, especially in JavaScript. I love building whatever pops into my head—one highlight was making a ticket bot for Discord. I’ve earned a few certs and take pride in troubleshooting my own code. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me staring at the grass outside my window for hours. Not big on social media—I pretty much live under a rock.

Let me know if you want it tweaked for a resume, LinkedIn (even if you don’t use it!), or any other context!
